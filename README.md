I've just complete the Enspiral Dev Academy Bootcamp which had me pump through about 700-800 hours of coding in 15 weeks!
So far I've learnt:
*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript
*React.js
*Redux.js
*Express.js
*Knex.js

A recent project was a rapid prototype called "1000 Words". It's a small game to get friends and family to interact digitally during COVID19. I've used it to explore Web Sockets and the bringing the canvas element into react using Konva.js!

Since finishing the bootcamp, I've been exploring:
* Kotlin
* C#
* React Native

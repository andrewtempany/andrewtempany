Hey!  return
I'm Andy.  return
I'm a Developer. I love video games, swimming and occasionally painting something. 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 1000 Words! a small game to get friends and family to interact digitally during COVID19. It's been great to explore how Web Sockets can impact the things that I make!
ðŸŒ± I've just completed a Bootcamp in which I learnt Javascript fullstack using React and Redux. I'm now exploring which directions I want to delve deeper!
